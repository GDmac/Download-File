Ok, here's how this works. You want to link to a file (e.g. a PDF or a JPG) but the browser is loading it instead of actually downloading it into the users Downloads folder.

Download File to the rescue!

We've created a plugin which works in 2 parts:

1. It creates a URL which points to a special template designed to serve files
2. It automatically converts a template into a file serving machine!

Other benefits.

1. Paths to your download files are hidden, with a BASE 64 string served instead
2. It's free - as in beer, so enjoy.
